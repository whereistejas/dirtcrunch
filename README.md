## `dirtcrunch`.
`dirtcrunch` is an [Airbyte](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) source wrapper written in Rust.

The crate provides a `Source` trait which can be implemented to interact with `Airbyte` source. This trait is based
on the Airbyte [specification](https://docs.airbyte.io/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-specification). We currently support
3 commands: `specs`, `discover` and `read`.

The enduser is not expected to implement the `Source` trait. The Source implementation for your specific connector will
be auto-generated by `dirtcrunch` when the crate is built using `build.rs`. You are supposed to use the default 
implementations of the trait methods to interact with the source.

An example consumer crate called [`watersip`](https://github.com/whereistejas/watersip) can be found here.
